# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

## With the story title defined

If you included the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Default

<Story id="a-l-t-a-i-r-button--default" />

### Success

<Story id="a-l-t-a-i-r-button--success" />

### Error

<Story id="a-l-t-a-i-r-button--error" />

### Loading

<Story id="a-l-t-a-i-r-button--loading" />

### ArgsTable

<ArgsTable of={ButtonComponent} />
